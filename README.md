# gnn_test

This is a scratch repository for testing out Graph Neural Network components in Julia. It isn't intended to do anything useful or coherent.

If you're interested in using Julia for Graph Neural Networks, check out the following external repositories:

[GraphNeuralNetworks.jl](https://github.com/CarloLucibello/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl)

[NeuralGraphPDE.jl](https://github.com/YichengDWu/NeuralGraphPDE.jl)

[Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl)

[Lux.jl](http://lux.csail.mit.edu/stable/)

Have fun!
